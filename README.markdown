# About

  This is a working prototype I built for a client-project in order to get user testing on some interface features. 
  The code was not test-driven, nor does it have unit tests as it was basically a giant spike, but I consider it fairly well structured.
  I used working on this as an opportunity to explore more of backbone.js and what it takes to build a full application.
  
  You're free to use any of this code as you see fit ;)
  
# Instructions

  Clone the repository, then run the included ruby serving script from your command prompt:
  
    $ ./serve.rb

  This should open your default browser and you will see the app running.
  
  Note: for the charting portion of the app only these 5 countries have data:
  
    - Brazil
    - India
    - China
    - Canada
    - United States
  
# Support

  This app runs great in Chrome, decent in Firefox and is untested in any other browsers.
