# About

  This is a working prototype I built for a client-project in order to get user testing on some interface features. 
  The code is untested, as it was basically a giant spike, but I consider it fairly well structured.
  I used working on this as an opportunity to explore more of backbone.js and what it takes to build a full application.
  
  You're free to use any of this code as you see fit ;)
