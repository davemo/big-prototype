    "overview" : "The political risk level in Chile is well below regional standards. The presidential election on 11 December 2005 was inconclusive as none of the four candidates received an absolute majority. Michelle Bachelet, a moderate socialist of the Concertacion coalition, won 53.49% of the vote to defeat Sebastian Pinera, a centre-right candidate from the Alianza por Chile coalition in a further runoff election among the topi two candidates on 15 January 2006. As a result, she succeeded President Ricardo Lagos on 11 March 2006 for a period of four years. Bachelet's inauguration meant that Chile had a female president for the first time in its history and the prospect of a fourth successive term in office for the centere-left Concertacion coalition.\nBachelet appears to have performed reasonably well during the early stages of her tenure, as evidenced by a 65% approval rate in a poll released by the Corporacion CERC at the end of May 2006. Positively, the overall political environment and Bachelet's policy efforts are likely to be aided by the fact that the Concertacion alliance has also won majorities in both the lower and upper houses of parliament for the first time. Bachelet has generally conformed to expectation in terms of pursuing the orthodox and prudent economic policies of her predecessor, allied with a greater focus on expanded social reform programs. Key areas of her social reform agenda include: education; health; pensions; reduced income inequality; increasing employment opportunities for women and young people; and ongoing constitutional reforms.\nMacroeconomic Risk\nWhile remaining generally buoyant, Chile's economic growth slowed to 5.1% in Q1 2006, from 5.8% in Q4 2005. Although continuing as the main driver of economic growth, domestic demand growth slowed to 8.3% year on year from 10.1% in Q4 2005. This moderate slowdown in domestic demand was partly attributable to high international oil prices and higher interest rates which had a negative impact on private consumption. From the supply side perspective, total economic output was adversely affected by a contraction in the agricultural sector due to unfavourable climatic conditions and reduced output of non-traditional crops.\nGoing forward, we expect the pattern of moderately slower economic growth to be repeated in subsequent quarters, resulting in forecast real GDP growth of 5.4% in 2006 as a whole. More specifically, domestic demand is expected to be constrained by tighter monetary conditions while the external environment will become somewhat less favourable due to slower economic growth in key trade partner nations and reduced market prices for copper. In 2007, real GDP growth is forecast to slow further to 5.1% due to the continued measured deceleration in domestic and external demand conditions.\nExternal Economic Risk\nChile's external accounts are among the most stable in Latin America. In recent years this performance has been underpinned particularly by the cyclical and possibly structural rise in the price of copper, Chile's most important export item. Going forward, the overall external economic outlook will remain broadly favourable. In Q1 2006, increased copper receipts helped the current account surplus to increase by 17.8% year on year to USD558m. More recent monthly data has shown that copper revenue in the first five months of 2006 stood at USD11.6bn, nearly double the USD6.6bn during the same period of 2005. While, import growth has also been strong (increasing by 24.7% year on year in Q1), we are forecasting a significantly increased trade surplus in 2006 and an expansion in Chile's current account surplus to around 1.3% of GDP.\nLooking further ahead to 2007, the outlook is necessarily more uncertain. We anticipate a moderate easing in the pace of global economic growth, with a concomitant reduction in the price of copper. This is consistent with the Chilean central bank's own forecast of reduction in the average price of copper in 2007. Indeed in D&B's view, the USD8,800 per tone all-time high price which was reached on 11 May, will remain the high point throughout the two-year forecast period (as of mid-June 2006, the price of copper had fallen by around 20% from this level, albeit remaining over 50% higher from the end of 2005). Given lower average copper prices, and the continuation of relatively robust demand conditions (which will help to support import growth) we are forecasting a reduction in overall current account surplus to around 0.5% of GDP in 2007.\n"
